Computer Architecture Lab1

## Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to reinforce the concepts of assembly language and assemblers. In this lab assignment, you will write an LC-3b Assembler, whose job will be to translate assembly language source code into the machine language (ISA) of the LC-3b. You will also write a program to solve a problem in the LC-3b Assembly Language.

## Usage
```
gcc -lm -std=c99 -o assemble assembler.c
./assemble shuffle.asm output.txt
```
