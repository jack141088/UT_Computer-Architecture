# UT ComputerArchitecture Lab5
Computer Architecture Lab5

## Introduction
The goal of this lab assignment is to extend the LC-3b simulator you wrote in Lab 4 to handle virtual memory. You will augment the existing LC-3b microarchitecture in order to support virtual to physical address translation. You will also provide microarchitectural support for page fault exceptions and change the protection exception from Lab 4 to be based on access mode in the PTE.

## Usage

### run add.asm
```
./gen_asm.sh
./run.sh
```

### run test asm
```
./gen_asm.sh
./test.sh [filename]
```
