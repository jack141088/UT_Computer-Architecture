# UT_Computer-Architecture
Computer Architecture Lab

## Introduction

### Lab1
The purpose of this lab is to reinforce the concepts of assembly language and assemblers. In this lab assignment, you will write an LC-3b Assembler, whose job will be to translate assembly language source code into the machine language (ISA) of the LC-3b. You will also write a program to solve a problem in the LC-3b Assembly Language.

### Lab2
For this assignment, you will write an instruction-level simulator for the LC-3b. The simulator will take one input file entitled isaprogram, which is an assembled LC-3b program.
The simulator will execute the input LC-3b program, one instruction at a time, modifying the architectural state of the LC-3b after each instruction.

### Lab3
For this assignment, you will write a cycle-level simulator for the LC-3b. The simulator will take two input files:
A file entitled ucode3 which holds the control store.
A file entitled isaprogram which is an assembled LC-3b program.
The simulator will execute the input LC-3b program, using the microcode to direct the simulation of the microsequencer, datapath, and memory components of the LC-3b.
